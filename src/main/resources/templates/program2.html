    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <p>An algorithm represents the ordered sequence of steps required to solve a problem. Following the steps will
        always result in the solution. When a computer is to solve a particular problem, the steps to the solution
        get communicated to the computer. This makes the study of algorithms an important part of computer science.</p>
    <p>The algorithm gets translated to a programming language, such as Java. The Java compiler will translate the
        program into instructions the computer can execute. This produces the required output from the given input.</p>
    <p>But translating the algorithm to computer code is not straight forward. To simplify the process, translate the
        algorithm into pseudocode. The pseudocode will then more easily translate into Java or another programming
        language.</p>
