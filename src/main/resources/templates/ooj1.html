    <h6>Classes and Objects</h6>
    <p>First there was functional or top-down programming. All programs had a single entry point and worked their
        way down, line by line, to a single exit point. They could jump around with various routines and go-to
        statements but all code was basically one large file. And it got cumbersome.</p>
    <h6>Division of Labor</h6>
    <p>Somehow the idea emerged that you could have a programmer develop code in units or blocks or what is now
        known as "classes". And these classes could be developed simultaneously and put together in a larger program.
        And re-used in other programs. And also tested independently. Once tested, they wouldn't have to be tested again.</p>
    <h6>Differences between classes and objects</h6>
    <p>The class is the code that will be executed, the type of data to be saved and the way it interacts with other
        things. The object is a particular instance of the class.</p>
